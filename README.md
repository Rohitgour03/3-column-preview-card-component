### Useful resources

To know about the CSS flexbox, I found this video-series really useful [CSS flexbox -by kevin powell](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4-IK0AVhVjMSb9c06AjRlTpvxL3otpUd)

And one more thing, if you want to know more specially about CSS, checkout the youtube channel of Kevin Powell. He is just amazing and explain the CSS in nice easy way and very clearly.
